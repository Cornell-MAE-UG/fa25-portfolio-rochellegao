For a class named Mechanics of Engineering Materials, we were asked to improve the design of a torque wrench through modification of the dimensions of the torque wrench handle as well as the torque wrench's material. The design of the torque wrench needs to meet the specified requirements regarding the voltage output and safety factors for yield failure, crack growth, and fatigue stress. We performed both hand calculations and analysis in ANSYS.
